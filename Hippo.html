                  <p class="lead"> <strong>Project Description:</strong> As the first group project for the UX/UI Bootcamp of the University of Minnesota, my team and I were tasked to create and design a solution for a common pain point.</p>
                  <hr class="my-4">
                  <p class="lead"><strong>The Problem:</strong>  Busy parents can have a hard time keeping track and communicating expectations and chores to their children.</p>
                  <p class="lead"><strong>The Solution:</strong>Hippo aims to develop a solution for busy parents to help their kids complete their household chores in a fun and innovative way. Hippo’s engaging and interactive model is also suitable for children to optimize productivity for the whole family.

                  <p class="lead"> <strong>Research:</strong>We interviewed 5 parents within our demographic and sent out surveys to more parents receiving 27 responses. We developed our interview, survey and process by asking questions that got to the core of the family chore dysfunction. We even asked if parents were molding their current chore and reward system after their childhood. Overwhelmingly respondents replied that they did not follow what their parents had done. The information we learned gave us great working knowledge of how parents think about household chores and how they want or don’t want to reward their kids for help at home. Doing user research also gave us vital important data on how household chores are organized inside families. We learned in our research that most of the time only one parent is keeping track of the kid's chores, what’s done and what isn’t and who is getting a reward. We found this does create stress for the one parent tasked with this responsibility.

                    We did research on competitors and found that current chore apps just fell short for customization and basic apps like google calendar didn’t cut it either and it was messy to track more than just the actual chore itself. These solutions don’t address the “family” reward of working towards a common goal.

                  <p class="lead"> <strong>User Testing:</strong>We conducted 2 user tests using the lo-fi prototype. Each user was given 5 tasks to complete. Both users completed all the tasks successfully, but we gained some valuable feedback and insights that caused us to reevaluate some of our navigation and flow. 
                    After in depth discussion, our team hashed out what needed to be done to resolve the problem. We reworked some of the screens, and adjusted what functions were connected where.</p>

                    <p class="lead"> <strong>Summary:</strong>Reflecting on this research study, we realized that we had a wider scope of our target audience and what we wanted the app to provide for our users. We noted that each parents’ experience with chore delegation was unique and provided us with a plethora of material to explore solutions for a family chore app. 

                      As our first group project, we took constructive feedback and adapted quickly to make iterations. Whenever we were confronted with a pain point, our team took initiative to stop and re-evaluate and not suffer from “analysis paralysis”. 
                      
                      If we were to take this study a step further or change anything, we would like to base our research on children around pre-teen to teen ages to understand their point of view and curate an app specifically for them.</p>
